I increased their random item range to be somewhere from 5-25. 
I changed the time in which shoppers arrive and made it random from 1-3 minutes.
I also changed the number of checkers to 2. 
changing these values ends with 0 people waiting in line, a wait time between 2.5-3.5 minutes, and a total idle time between 100-135 minutes.
Because I do have some random values, the wait time and idle time will vary but these are the numbers I got when running the code.
I learned that increasing something like checkers will decrease wait time, but increase idle time. Which means people would be standing around getting paid.
